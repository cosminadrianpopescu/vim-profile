  layout - *DONE*

* change the maxrows query. the documentation states that the set maxrows in

Bugs

* when opening 2 sql buffers on the same profile - *FIXED*
* highlight on search data still not working properly
* if the folder location changes, the variables will not be restored, since
  the key is the buffer name - *FIXED*
* ignore comments on autocomplete - *FIXED*
* autocomplete is case sensitive - *FIXED*
* when autocomplete files for swsqlopen, add a path at the end if it's a
  folder - *NOT WORTH*
* in dbexporer, get source looses the last row - *FIXED*
